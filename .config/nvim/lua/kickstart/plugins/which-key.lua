-- File: lua/kickstart/plugins/which-key.lua

-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end

-- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
return {
  'folke/which-key.nvim',
  event = 'VimEnter',
  config = function() -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading
    require('which-key').setup()

    -- Document existing key chains
    require('which-key').add {
      { '<leader>c', group = '[C]ode', mode = { 'n', 'x' } },
      { '<leader>d', group = '[D]ocument' },
      { '<leader>r', group = '[R]ename' },
      { '<leader>s', group = '[S]earch' },
      { '<leader>w', group = '[W]orkspace' },
    }
  end,
}
